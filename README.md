# Design Patterns in React (CSCI E-39)

*Note: as of 4/15/18, Windows is using Node / npm directly rather than Docker. These
docs will be relevant only for Mac users until we decide if Docker usage will be
deprecated entirely.*

*For the time being, Windows users should install Node 8.\* and npm 5.\*, and use the
make.sh script. The commands are all virtually identical, except `make` becomes
`bash make.sh`*

## Accounts and Tools

1. [Github](https://github.com/) account
1. [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com) account
1. Install [Docker for Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows) | [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac)
    - for Windows, also install [git-bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)

## Installation

1. Start Docker
1. Open Terminal / git-bash and run
    1. `mkdir -p ~/Projects && cd ~/Projects`
    1. `git clone git@github.com:tshelburne/csci-e39.git && cd csci-e39`
    1. `echo your-id-goes-here > .id`, replacing "your-id-goes-here" with your student ID
    1. `make build migrate`

## Repo documentation

See the [Docs](./docs) directory.

## Automated tasks

To see all tasks, run `make`

### Application

1. `make start` starts the app and connects to a local environment
1. `make live` starts the app and connects to the live environment
1. `make stop` stops any running version of the app (`start`, `watch`, `live`, etc.)

### Development

1. `make clean` resets the directory to a fresh installation
1. `make watch` starts the app, connects to a local environment, and recompiles when source code changes
1. `make activate assignment=[assignment name]` updates the app to enable the specific assignment directory

### DevOps

1. `make migration name=[migration name]` creates a new database migration file
1. `make migrate` updates the local database schema
1. `make publish` publishes the current container to Dockerhub
1. `make deploy` deploys the current container to Heroku
1. `make migrate-prod` updates the live Heroku database schema
